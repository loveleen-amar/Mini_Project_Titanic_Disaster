# Mini_Project_Titanic_Disaster
Our aim in Titanic Dataset is to predict the survival status of passengers

**The task:**  The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. Unfortunately, in that incident there werenâ€™t enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Our aim in Titanic Dataset is to predict the survival status of passengers.
